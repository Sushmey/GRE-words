# GRE-words
This is a simple website that I made using JSX in React.
Used media queries to make it look good on mobile devices too.

I couldn't find an appropriate dictionary in json format so I made my own using the words I found on [this Magoosh webpage](https://s3.amazonaws.com/magoosh.resources/magoosh-gre-1000-words_oct01.pdf) and wrote a code in python to add the words to a json file. You can use it to add more words to it.
